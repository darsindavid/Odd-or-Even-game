# Odd or Even Game

## Overview
The "Odd or Even" game is a simple console-based game where players compete against the computer. The player chooses a number and whether they want the total of their number and the computer's number to be odd or even. The game consists of a toss phase and a batting phase.

## Game Rules
1. The player is prompted to choose either "Odd" or "Even".
2. The player then selects a number between 0 and 6.
3. The computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 6.
4. The total of both numbers is calculated.
5. If the total matches the player's choice (odd or even), the player wins the toss and can choose to bat or bowl. If not, the player loses the toss.
6. The game continues with the batting phase where the player can score runs based on their choices.
